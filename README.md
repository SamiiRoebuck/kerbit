## Kerbit

University final project

Aim - Use a custom image classification machine learning model, built using Google AutoML, to create a PWA that allow users to take a photo of items they wish to recycle and the model will predict what the item is/its material and whether it can be recycled, and which bin to put it in or take it to a recycling center. Currently only modelled to work in Leeds, UK.
